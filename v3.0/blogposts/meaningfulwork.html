    <h1>The Meaning of Work</h1>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark-Lepper-2/publication/232561384_Turning_Play_Into_Work_Effects_of_Adult_Surveillance_and_Extrinsic_Rewards_on_Children%27s_Intrinsic_Motivation/links/56107d6608aec422d1155896/Turning-Play-Into-Work-Effects-of-Adult-Surveillance-and-Extrinsic-Rewards-on-Childrens-Intrinsic-Motivation.pdf">In 1975, two Stanford professors</a> had 90 preschoolers solve a series of puzzles. They were trying to understand how rewards and surveillance affect the intrinsic interest people have in an activity. They tested this by splitting the preschoolers along two dimensions, by whether they were told of a reward for good performance and whether they would be watched through a one-way mirror. They found that both the expectation of a reward and being surveilled made the preschoolers less likely to play with the puzzles when given the option a week later.

        These results align with the common sentiment that when you’re paid to do what you love, you can begin to dread it. Many of my peers (college-educated millennials/gen-Z) view work as a necessary evil of living in a modern, capitalist society. Simultaneously, many of them also get a lot of meaning out of their work or at least they build their identity around it. For this group, finding a balance between meaningful work and work that can financially enable you to pursue other meaningful endeavors, such as travel or starting a family, is the guiding question of their twenties. In his seminal book, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Life_in_Classrooms/W46Gu6wwYsQC?hl=en">Life in Classrooms</a>, Philip Jackson says the distinction between work and play is introduced to most people in the classroom. As children, we learn that “work entails… an activity in which we would not at the moment be engaged if it were not for some system of authority relationships.”

        While this definition could be debated for entrepreneurs or CEOs leading their company, for the vast majority of my peers, we find ourselves working for someone else. That someone else largely decides our goals, activities, and performance metrics with varying allowances for self-determination. Once you graduate from the classroom, work is additionally linked to wages which, unfortunately, seem to decrease one’s intrinsic interest in the work activities. However, I doubt anyone is willing to forgo pay to avoid this effect because most paths to a meaningful life require some financial footing which can only be gotten through work. This leads us to an unfortunate reality of work, it requires us to do things we dislike, and it makes us dislike things we’re required to do, even if we initially liked them.

        This then begs the question, if work activities tend to be disliked, how can work be made meaningful? One thinker who had a very positive view of work was Ayn Rand, a controversial figure in philosophy that promoted laissez-faire capitalism. In her book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/817219-atlas-shrugged">Atlas Shrugged</a>, she says “productive work is the process by which man's consciousness controls his existence… of remaking the earth in the image of one's values… work is the purpose of your life… any value you might find outside your work, any other loyalty or love, can be only travelers you choose to share your journey”. Rand’s position is an extreme one, with no room for meaningful relationships or experiences that could stand on an equal footing with work. However, she was right to suggest that a person’s working life has the greatest potential to shape the world according to one’s values.

        Elon Musk has a profound effect on his immediate family. His marriages, and subsequent divorces, a school he created to educate his own children, and the attention he gives to his friends, doubtlessly affect those closest to him. However, if you removed Elon Musk’s personal life from the history of the world, all the immediate impacts on his family and friends, and any knock-on effects from these, we would likely be living in a very similar world. On the other hand, if you remove his professional impact on the world, the growth of companies like Tesla and Space X, or the buying out of Twitter, the world would be very different. A person’s work can scale through political, ideological, and economic mechanisms to become massively impactful in a way that personal relationships simply cannot. Elon Musk is an extreme example, and most of the characters in Atlas Shrugged, such as Hank Rearden, a steel tycoon, and Dagny Taggert, the operator of a transcontinental railroad, are as well. The impact of a person’s work rarely scales to global or national proportions. For most people, the value of their work is either obscured by the complex systems they operate in, or their environment is simple but limited in scale. Therefore, the potential meaning one can get from work that “remakes the earth in the image of one’s values” is real but rarely realized.

        On the other hand, other sources of meaning like relationships are more evenly distributed throughout society. For most people, relationships provide more meaning than their work could, in part, because their work doesn’t seem very important in the grand scheme of things. If you allow me to grossly simplify, it’s like the meaning we derive from our personal lives is normally distributed across individuals while the meaning we derive from professional impact is exponentially distributed. Which means most individuals lie below a threshold that would allow them to get greater value from their professional lives than their personal. There are exceptions like Musk, Rearden, and Taggert but they’re rare.

        Another source of meaning that one could get from their work is a sense of intrinsic pride in a job well done. This was, perhaps, a more common source of value in pre-industrial times when the economy was composed largely of local shopkeepers and craftsman. This source of meaning is evident in Japan’s “shokunin”, or especially devoted craftsmen. Even <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200219-the-future-of-japans-master-artisans">shoe shining</a> can be elevated into an artisan craft which raises both its economic and cultural value. However, an intrinsic pride in one’s work doesn’t necessarily entail a correspondingly high value for society. In fact, the production of traditionally made goods in Japan has decreased from $540 billion to $96 billion over the past 40 years. The decrease of this type of value in work may be a consequence of industrialization and the increasing push to make things cheaper and faster. When you can buy ten mass-produced plates for $5 instead of one hand-crafted plate for $10, the finances will guide your decision. Hand-crafted objects have increasingly become luxuries and only the best of the “shokunin” still survive, whose mastery warrants the luxurious prices. Some people think that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328721000872">a revival in craftsmanship will be required</a> in post-automation society where most people’s work is unnecessary. They believe technology will allow people to cheaply produce luxury goods in a new economic regime, so called “Fully Automated Luxury Communism”. However, communism doesn’t have a great track record for transitioning into, therefore, it may be more pragmatic to consider ways in which we can reintroduce this type of meaning into work in a capitalist society.

        So far we have identified three types of meaning that people derive from work:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Pay: which can be used to pursue other meaningful life projects
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Purpose: which is how your work contributes to a greater purpose
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Pride: the intrinsic value derived from doing something expertly
    </p>
    <p>
        The important question for anyone looking to build a career intentionally, that contributes  rather than detracts, from living a meaningful life, is to figure out how to incorporate some combination of these values into one’s work. Some people may prioritize raising a family and hence sufficient and stable pay is the most important dimension of work. Some may have grand visions of how the world needs to evolve and so pursue a purposeful career. Others may be content with meaningful daily work, where they can create things they take pride in.

        What other value do you derive from your work?
